# Mohamed BERKAT's GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub profile! üëã

I am Mohamed Berkat, a passionate **Cybersecurity Engineering Student** with hands-on experience in **malware analysis**, **reverse engineering**, and **security testing**. My journey in the world of cybersecurity and technology spans multiple domains, from **offensive security** to **defensive measures**, and I am constantly looking to push the boundaries of my knowledge.

I am deeply interested in topics such as **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**, **network security**, **penetration testing**, and **malware development**, and I am excited to continue learning and contributing to the field.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Expertise

- **Cybersecurity**: SIEM solutions, ELK Stack, Wazuh, incident response, and threat hunting.
- **Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering**: Static and dynamic analysis, code injection, shellcode, and exploit development.
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, Rust, Assembly, Bash, and experience with embedded systems development.
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Genymotion, Drozer, Android SDK, Kali Linux, Wireshark, and Metasploit.
- **Networking**: SNMP, pcap files, network packet analysis.
- **DevOps**: Working knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and version control with Git.

## üîç My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've been working on:

### 1. **CyberSOC with ELK Stack and Wazuh**
   - A full SIEM solution that simulates real-world attack scenarios using the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and **Wazuh**.
   - Key skills: **Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, **Kibana**, **Wazuh**, **threat intelligence**, and **incident response**.

### 2. **Malware Analysis Toolkit**
   - A set of tools designed for **reverse engineering** and **malware analysis**.
   - Includes static and dynamic analysis tools, debuggers, and decompilers like **Jadx**, **IDA Pro**, and **Ghidra**.

### 3. **Android Security Testing**
   - A project aimed at **Android security**, where I used tools such as **Drozer** and **Genymotion** to identify vulnerabilities in mobile apps.
   - Focus on insecure data storage and code injection techniques.

### 4. **Embedded Systems Security**
   - Working on an **embedded security project** using **Arduino Uno** and **Wokwi** to simulate real-world scenarios, including **temperature control** and **gas detection** with sound and visual alerts.
   - Focus on **IoT security** and embedded system vulnerabilities.

## üí° Current Focus

I am currently exploring the following areas:

- **Ransomware Analysis**: Investigating the techniques and tactics used by ransomware actors and analyzing potential defense mechanisms.
- **Exploit Development**: Crafting **proof-of-concept exploits** and learning how to protect applications from vulnerabilities.
- **Red Teaming**: Improving skills in penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, and social engineering tactics.
- **Homelab Projects**: Setting up various security testing environments and simulations to better understand **network traffic analysis**, **web application security**, and **data breach prevention**.
